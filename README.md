# Emory University 2036 Campaign Website

Aspirational and visionary, the 2036 Campaign invests in people for the
benefit of people. Not only about how Emory moves forward but also how
investments in Emory will lead to a better world, 2O36 presents an inspiring
vision of what we will accomplish together.

The website engages Emory donors and constituents with stories, the “why”, the
potential impact of the campaign; communicating the goals of each of Emory’s
schools & units in order to raise awareness, increase engagement, and ultimately, garner financial support for the University.


# Milestones

* Phase 1 (September 2021-February 2022ish) - soft launch. Goals to drum up
interest in the campaign, geared toward, but not exclusively focused on, major
and principal gift donors. Campaign committee members will also need access to specific information on the site.

* Phase 2 (February 2022-the life of the campaign) - public launch to a broader Emory audience, including the full alumni base, faculty, staff, students,
parents, community members.

## Tech Stack

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Development

* Install javascript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

* Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* Open [http://localhost:3000/intro](http://localhost:3000/intro) in your browser.


## Getting Started

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
