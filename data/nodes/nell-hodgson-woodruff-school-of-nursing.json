Massive financial and emotional burdens are expected to reach new heights in the coming years. On average, care for people living with dementia exceeds insurance reimbursement by $500 to $1,000 per year, per patient. <strong>Philanthropic support through 2O36 is key for Integrated Memory Care and will allow Emory School of Nursing to expand this model across the United States, improving care and quality of life for millions of families.</strong><p>A partnership of Emory University’s Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Department of Neurology, and Department of Psychiatry, Integrated Memory Care (IMC) is a nurse-led medical home that addresses both the primary care needs and unique challenges that dementia patients and their care partners face. It is the only nurse-led center of its kind, treating each patient’s dementia and other chronic conditions using a palliative care framework and engaging the care partner as a key member of the care team. This celebrated clinic has been honored for six continuous years as a Patient-Centered Medical Home, recognized as an Age-Friendly Health System by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and chosen as a Best Practice exemplar by the Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care.</p>"

Depending on the area of study, our master of science in nursing (MSN) graduates typically carry $60,000 to $95,000 in debt. These substantial costs keep many new nurses from pursuing rewarding career opportunities. We want to change that.</p><p><strong>With your generous support of 2O36, the School of Nursing can establish an endowed scholarship fund to ensure student financial assistance in perpetuity, making a nursing education at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels more accessible.</strong> That access strengthens and diversifies the field of nursing, health care overall, and Emory’s standing as a leading educational institution.</p>"
