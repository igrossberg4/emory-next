These areas of strength have the power to transform how undergraduate students learn, preparing them to carry new perspectives into careers in every field.</p><p>For our nationally recognized <strong>Creative Writing Program, an endowed fellowship</strong> would attract and assist emerging writers, enhance the curriculum, and further build the program’s reputation. 2O36 will support an environment for writers to produce work that will be read, awarded, and widely taught. <strong>An endowment for the Department of African American Studies</strong> will help redefine understanding of race, inequality, and justice. This endowment could launch a PhD program in antiracism and the study of racial inequality, for example, or fund a research center to study contemporary and historical slavery or address health inequities.</p><p><strong>An endowment for the Center for Human Health,</strong> which brings Emory’s top researchers into the classroom, would allow visiting scholars to spend a year working with undergraduates on new developments in health. <strong>Endowed funding for the Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods</strong> (QTM) could create new research clusters in forward-focused areas such as data justice—bringing the data sciences into collaborations with scholars of race and racism—or biomedical sciences.
