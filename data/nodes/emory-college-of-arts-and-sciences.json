They draw students out of their individual experiences into the wide world of ideas, provide ethical understanding, and teach both critical and creative thinking. Students emerge from Emory College more human and more humane, with the moral imagination to address larger issues with clarity and compassion.</p><p>Emory does an artful job of educating students by harnessing both the strengths of a liberal arts college and the expertise of a research university. This powerful combination creates purpose-driven alumni who approach the world as problem-solvers, communicators, and leaders for a lifetime.</p>",

This effort will result in more Emory faculty serving as international commentators on the most important issues of our  times in forums that define public scholarship and increase the number of faculty who are  members of international academies.</p>",
