Emory faculty do more than just teach. They are distinguished scientists and researchers, authors, and public intellectuals who’ve become household names, like Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent; and Carol Anderson, the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide. Among our distinguished faculty, we can boast of two Pulitzer Prize and two Nobel Peace Prize winners.</p><p>Our faculty’s commitment to their communities and their students leaves an impression well beyond their time at Emory. While inspiring students and driving educational excellence, Emory’s world-renowned professors have the attention of their peers, both in their fields and related fields. Because top scholars want to study, teach, and work alongside each other, the more our faculty are recognized as leaders in their fields, the more they attract new highly respected faculty. <strong>By funding 2O36, you can help facilitate these academics’ research pursuits so they can reach their full potential and achieve such distinction.</strong></p>",
