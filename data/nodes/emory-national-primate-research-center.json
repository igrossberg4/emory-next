EPC research is grounded in scientific integrity, expert knowledge, an open exchange of ideas, a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and compassionate, quality animal care. The research center, the oldest scientific institute dedicated to nonhuman primate research, paved the way for the National Institutes of Health-funded National Primate Research Center program. With our researchers’ help, these national centers search for the causes, preventions, treatments, and cures that lead to longer, healthier lives worldwide.</p>",
