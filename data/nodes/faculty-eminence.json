Exciting research in the humanities, social sciences, law, and theology is uncovering how to advance social and racial justice. Our scientists and biomedical researchers are working toward eliminating cancer and the effects of brain traumas. Future modeling is helping us understand how artificial intelligence can better serve humanity. Fundamental for professors in a multitude of fields, research leads to new ideas and profound discoveries, keeps their academic and educational priorities fresh and relevant, and helps propel their careers and professional reputations forward. <strong>Funding through 2O36 offers faculty resources to purchase needed equipment and software licenses, pay support staff, and afford travel for field research.</strong></p><p>Funding faculty research will help us recruit and retain faculty members. Research discoveries  inform new academic pedagogy, create new knowledge,  and lead to  publication opportunities that can reach new audiences and win awards.
