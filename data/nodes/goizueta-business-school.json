More broadly, they benefit communities by establishing a pipeline of diverse and talented students prepared  to join (or rejoin) the workforce.</p><p><strong>Your support of scholarships helps us attract and retain top students to Goizueta's degree programs; and to improve the diversity and talent of our student body.</strong> Our goal is to create equal access and opportunity for all students with the talent and abilities to drive business forward, regardless of their ability to pay.
