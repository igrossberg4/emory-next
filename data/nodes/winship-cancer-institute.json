When they can visualize molecular-level interactions with a high degree of precision, developing strategies for cancer prevention and treatment becomes more feasible. And imaging technology can improve detection, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and the prediction of efficacy. <strong>An investment in new technology through 2O36 will reach beyond Winship to ensure that our many collaborators in the broader cancer community—in Georgia, throughout the nation, and around the world—will have access to the tools of innovation.</strong></p>"
