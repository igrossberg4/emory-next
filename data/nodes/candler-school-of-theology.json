Our faculty members’ passion for teaching challenges students to reach beyond the comfortable and convenient as they learn what it means to serve.</p><p>The caliber of our biblical studies faculty has always been a mark of distinction for Candler, but unlike peer institutions like Yale, Duke, and Vanderbilt, we don’t currently have an endowed faculty position in biblical studies. And while Candler has recruited several notable faculty members to replace recently retired biblical studies professors, there’s a constant need for distinguished theological professors. <strong>A generous gift to 2O36 will allow us to create a named chair of biblical studies to lead the charge in training tomorrow’s faith leaders and scholars.</strong></p>"

In this paradigm, deep, integrative learning is nurtured using all the gifts and challenges of a student’s particular place.</p><p><strong>With your support for 2O36, we can use new technical possibilities to shift the paradigm for education at Candler and other theological schools.</strong> Through this work, Candler can respond to the pluralities in the 21st century South and develop academic and theological programs that meet the needs of these communities.
