We know that far more people are interested in deep theological learning than the number who enroll in degree programs, or even the number who consider themselves “religious.” In today’s global, digitally connected world, Candler envisions making theological education accessible to more people in more formats, more places, and in response to more motivations.</p><p><strong>With your support for 2O36, we can build our capacity for public theological education, using not only technology, but strong partnerships with churches and community organizations to ensure our offerings address their needs.</strong> This new, comprehensive model of theological education for degree and nondegree students will enhance our ability to serve a wide variety of populations, including those who identify as spiritual but not religious.</p>"
