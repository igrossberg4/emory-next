Dymond began her first career in social services, shifted to reproductive health, served as a pro bono doula for more than 20 years, raised two sons, and eventually came to the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing. Through Emory’s innovation lab, The Hatchery, she received a grant to develop a mobile midwifery service to reach underserved communities.

In this talk, Nam explores questions of identity and how, by understanding the past, we can develop greater empathy for each other today. </p>",
