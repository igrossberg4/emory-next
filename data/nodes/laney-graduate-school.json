It provides time at a pivotal stage, as they develop their dissertations into monographs or other foundational scholarly products.</p><p><strong>2O36 will support this fellowship in attracting diverse, recent PhDs at the leading edge of their fields.</strong> Members of the Emory Society of Fellows will be recruited through regular assistant professor searches, with deferred appointments that provide two years of support as they develop professionally.
