00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:04.220
(gentle music)

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Man one>You know, when you're growing up,</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.400
when you're very young,

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.600
people tell you, you can do whatever you wanna do.

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Lady one>By investing in people,</v>

6
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.550
we're investing in the mission of the university

7
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.550
and ultimately our desire to address complex human problems.

8
00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Man one>People tell you if you work hard,</v>

9
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.000
you can have whatever you like.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.440
People tell you all of these things about discipline

11
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.620
and about love and about freedom,

12
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.940
and I thought all of those things were true.

13
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Man two>I think there is a sense</v>

14
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.300
that we are at an inflection point

15
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.420
in the history of this university.

16
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Lady two>We've barely begun to scratch the surface.</v>

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Man three>If we can make it happen</v>

18
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.680
and even greater excellence than we currently see.

19
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Man four>That we are moving from excellence,</v>

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.110
that we have in many categories to real eminence.

21
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Lady three>I think destiny is an evolving thing.</v>

22
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.083
<v Man five>I think that Emory was destined for excellence.</v>

23
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.673
(upbeat music)
